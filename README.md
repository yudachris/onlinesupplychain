Online Beer Game
My final project to complete my bachelor's degree in 2016.

No, it is not a game where you have beer and get drunk. It is a game based on a supply chain simulation board game developed at MIT in 1950s. See <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/520181/the-beer-game/">here</a> to see how the traditional game is played.
My version, I make it so it can be played by tens of people with minimal preparation and quick setup. With a RPG-like strategy twist! With a responsive design, you can play it in any device with modern web browser. 

The game was designed at the end of 2015, then developed for about 7 months and finished in June 2016. This game contributed an "A" in my final project and allowed me to have my degree.

Feel free to give yor review or opinion or even a correction to my messy code back in 2016.
Thank YOU for visiting!
